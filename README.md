## Library Highlights
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io) - The beauty of ES6/2015 is there and babel allows you to use those features right now.
* [Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org) is promise-based HTTP client. In our case, we're going with [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch).
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org) keeps your mind at east when it comes to code conformity.
* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) - Provides great reduction of UI complexity and is not only fast, but creates a consistent way of reasoning the entire development of components.
* [D3-Cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud) - Extremely useful piece of code that provides collision detection and can be used even in more pure data cycles.
* [Immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js) - Immutability FTW!
* [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) - Testing utility that provides very neat customization options.
